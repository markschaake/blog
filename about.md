My name is Mark Schaake, and I've been developing software since 2005. I aim to blog about various software topics - probably mostly revolving around Scala.

Since 2012, I've primarily used Scala professionally. Most of my recent work has been akka-centric, with heavy use of spray (and now akka-http) for web services, and more recently akka-cluster for building a distributed crawler for the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence][ai2]. I try to span the full stack, and have heavily used AngularJS and React.js on the client-side. (I've been all-in with React since early 2015 and no longer touch AngularJS code).

Recently, I've been more interested in functional programming as a means to reduce chaos that creeps in with imperative style code (which I've written a lot of especially when writing actors). I recently watched several talks from [Scala World][scala-world-youtube]. I was particularly inspired by Debasish Ghosh's excellent talk on [Functional Patterns in Domain Modeling][debasish-domain-modeling]. Thinking of your domain in terms of an "Algebra" was eye-opening for me, and I was inspired to gain experience applying that philosophy.

My method for learning: build up a "consulting" toolkit that is as purely functional as I can make it. My "consulting" toolkit will also include some [Scala.js][scala-js] (and [Scala.js React][scala-js-react] with [ScalaCSS][scala-css], which I'll write about in another post coming soon).
